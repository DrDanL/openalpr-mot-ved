    "I cycle, a lot, and I use a front-facing GoPro camera to protect me from rogue drivers, cyclist and pedestrians. Last week I made a report of bad driving (super close pass) and the Metropolitan Police not only charged the driver with dangerous driving, but also for driving with an MOT. This incident got me thinking, wouldn't it be great to have you own Automatic Number Plate Recognition (aka ANPR) system?\n",
